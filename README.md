# Overviiew 

This repository contains code for forecasting the 2020 US preisential election. It was created by Timothey Regis, Ankhee Paul, Chen Shupeng, and Kashaun Eghdam. The purpose of this is to create a report that summarises the results of a statistial model that we built. The data that we used for our anaylisis is unable to be shared publicly. We detail how to obtain this data below. The sections of this repo are: inputs, outputs, scripts.

Inputs contain data that are unchanged from their original. We use two datasets: 

- [Survey data - detail how to get the survey data.]
- [ACS data - detail how to get the ACS data.]

Outputs contain data that are modified from the input data, the report and supporting material.

- X, 
- Y

Scripts contain R scripts that take inputs and outputs and produce outputs. These are:

- 01_data_cleaning.R
- 02_data_preparation.R
